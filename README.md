## Why Did I Choose The Above Technologies?

Ant Design

> Ant Design is a great looking design system that's easy to implement and tweak. It allows you to get up and running quickly by providing sleek components while keeping a professional design in mind.

Styled-Components

> Used for minor tweaks that were needed. I didn't see a need to create seperate CSS files for this project since styling was minimal.

Cypress

> I decided to use Cypress for testing. The reason I chose this tool over others, such as Jest, was my lack of experience with it. I've been wanting to learn how to use Cypress and I found this project to be the perfect opportunity.

## Storing Account Credentials

> I decided to utilize local storage to store account credentials. This allowed for easy access to usernames and passwords when needed. I also created an authorization flag and held the boolean value in local storage. Local storage allowed me to hold all credential-related values in one place.
